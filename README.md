## Java Resources for Beginner

### Basics

>Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. With Java you can build various types of applications such as desktop, web, mobile apps and distributed systems. 
Java Development Kit 
>We use Java Development Kit (JDK) to build Java applications. JDK contains a compiler, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and a library of classes that we use to build applications.  
Java Editions.

>We have four editions of Java, each used for building a different type of application:  
•Java Standard Edition (SE): the core Java platform. It contains all of the libraries that every Java developer must learn.  
•Java Enterprise Edition (EE): used for building very large scale, distributed systems. It’s built on top of Java SE and provides additional libraries for building fault-tolerant, distributed, multi-tier software.  
•Java Micro Edition (ME): a subset of Java SE, designed for mobile devices. It also has libraries specific to mobile devices. 
•Java Card: used in smart cards.

### How Java Code Gets Executed 
>The Java compiler takes Java code and compiles it down to Java Bytecode which is a cross-platform format. When we run Java applications, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) gets loaded in the memory. It takes our bytecode as the input and translates it to the native code for the underlying operating system. There are various implementations of Java Virtual Machine for almost all operating systems.  
Architecture of Java Applications  
>The smallest building blocks in Java programs are methods (also called functions in other programming languages). We combine related methods in classes, and related classes in packages. This modularity in Java allows us to break down large programs into smaller building blocks that are easier to understand and re-use.
